# Orcheed

A Granblue Fantasy companion Chrome extension, a reborn continuation of [Ancheera](https://github.com/Thessiah/Ancheera).

# TODO

We'll see if I'll add my own features or just bugfixing it.

# Development

In your Chrome extensions page, click "Load unpacked extension..." and point to the repo. To recompile after changes, hit the reload button beneath the extension. The styles are written with sass, so you'll need a sass compiler like compass which should watch the src folder for changes.
